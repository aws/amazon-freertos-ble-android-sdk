## Announcement:
As of July 15th, 2023, this repository is deprecated. The contents of this repository will remain available but we will no longer provide updates or accept new contributions and pull requests. We recommend you start [here](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/android/) for creating interactions between an Android device and AWS. For Bluetooth Low Energy APIs we recommend you start [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth/ble-overview).

Over the years, both Android and AWS have improved significantly. Since the initial release of this package, several new Android version have release brining with them enhanced security and usability. AWS Amplify has also [release dozens of later versions](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/releases) of the [AWS SDK](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android) with many new features and bug fixes.

The amazon-freertos-ble-android-sdk is being deprecated to remove a misleading example built on outdated code.
